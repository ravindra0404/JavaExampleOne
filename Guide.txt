Hi Kavya, 

I did some exmples they are...

Successfull Attemp: 

1. Install Git in your system and Create a public accout in Git Hub.
	
	Note : GIT and GITHUB are different.
	GIT -> Creating for local repository.
	GITHUB -> Creating for remote repository.

2. Create one remote repository in GITHUB and copy the link of the repository.

Fallow the step to create the GIT local repository and similarly for the GITHUB remote repository.

3. Fallow the step to create the basic java project in jenkins and run the program in jenkins (Both eclipse and normal local java file).

4. Did PUSH and PULL operation using GIT and GITHUB.

Un-successfull Attemp: Please try to configure 

1. I am unable to configure the Git in Jenkins(Error : Failed to connect to repository :Error performing command:  ls-remote -h git@github.com:ravindra0404/JavaExample.git HEAD).

2. I am unable to do the configuration for Junit testing in Jenkins.
